Officers remain on scene.”\r\nOther campaigners gathered on the flyover to chant “no ifs, no buts, no third runway” and “no more runways” in the protest organised by the campaign group RisingUp! Placards reading “Heathrow expansion will destroy thousands of homes” and “protect the planet, no more runways”, were also held high.\r\nA spokesman for the group said: “The government’s decisions to expand Heathrow, despite mass opposition from local residents and the fact that doing so is incompatible with the UK’s own laws on climate change, leaves us with no morally acceptable option but to resist.\r\n“Only 15% of the British public is responsible for 70% of international flights taken in the UK and Heathrow largely serves international passengers who have a mean income of £57,000 per year.\r\n“This expansion is being driven by the very rich at the expense of some of the poorest people in the world.”\r\nNeil Keveren, a resident of nearby Harmondsworth, said: “Democracy has failed us. Elected leaders have totally reversed the will of the people.\r\n“As a direct result, the quality of life and life expectancy of the population here will be shorter. This is against our human rights and must be defended.\r\n“Who is left to correct this injustice when our politicians will not? The answer is us, you and me.”\r\n",

It did not announce the result but said he was asymptomatic before the test, which was also administered to those in his close proximity. \r\nNetanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, is fighting for his political life after an inconclusive election on March 2, following ballots in April and September that also ended without a clear victor. \r\nIn his legal cases, Netanyahu is accused of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts from tycoons, which prosecutors say included cigars and champagne, and of dispensing regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website. \r\nHe could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The second is a chauffeur. Legal sources said the driver was not regarded as a central figure, but is helping in the investigation.\r\nMr Winship's lawyer added: \"Mr Winship fully denied any wrongdoing. He was informed by the investigating officer following the interview that no action would be taken against him.\"\r\nThe SFO said: \"We can confirm that as part of the ongoing investigation jointly undertaken by the SFO and the Ministry of Defence police into companies contracted by BAE to provide services in connection with defence equipment contracts with the government of Saudi Arabia , a 73-year-old man and a 65-year-old man attended Holborn police station by appointment.\"\r\nBoth men were arrested and interviewed on suspicion of money-laundering, the statement said, before being released.\r\nBAE last night remained silent. The latest moves are expected to bring closer a decision by Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general, on whether to prosecute Britain's biggest arms company, which gets more than £1bn a year from Riyadh for running much of the Saudi regime's air force.\r\nThe significance of the SFO's fresh arrests is that they represent a completely new turn in the corruption investigation.\r\nIt was originally sparked by disclosures in the Guardian of the lavish lifestyle enjoyed at BAE's expense by the Saudi prince in charge of the long-running arms contract. Payments were signed off by top BAE executives.\r\nIt is understood that the new money-laundering investigations relate to events as recently as this year.\r\nThe SFO is currently compiling lengthy witness statements from those involved, with a view to putting the case before law officers by the end of this year.\r\n",

The investigators say the managers illegally \"diverted\" billions from Petrobras' accounts for their activities.\r\nMore than 80 people have been charged in connection with the scandal.\r\nWolf Popper law firm, which represents Petrobras' shareholders in a class action lawsuit, said the oil company was also releasing false statements and misleading investors about its asset values.\r\n\r\nPetrobras ( PBRA ) stock has fallen 53% since September when the scandal first erupted. Its credit default swaps, indicating the risk investors attach to the company, soared over 200 basis points this year alone, and credit rating companies Fitch and Moody's downgraded it to junk.\r\nBut when news of the corporate shake up emerged on Tuesday, Petrobras regained some value, rising 16%.\r\nSome say the resignations might give the oil giant a fresh start. Petrobras is sitting on one of the largest oil discoveries in the world.\r\n\"(It) has huge potential. This may be an opportunity for Petrobras to get back on track and move past the corruption controversy,\" said Gianna Bern, the author of Investing in Energy and former senior director at Fitch Ratings.\r\n",

It can lead to severe hepatitis and hemorrhaging, according to the CDC.\r\nThere is no specific treatment for yellow fever, and care is based on symptoms that include fever, backache, nausea and vomiting. People can pass on the illness without ever having its symptoms.\r\nThe World Health Organization estimates there are 200,000 cases of yellow fever and 30,000 deaths worldwide each year. Uganda's last outbreak of yellow fever, a disease endemic to tropical regions, was in the early 1970s, Kenya-Mugisha said. \r\nCNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.\r\n\r\n",

They are demanding the resignation of the government and the king, as well as a rewrite of Spain's constitution.\r\nAuthorities have estimated the number of protesters at 6,000 – relatively small by Spanish standards.\r\nSeveral key parts of the peaceful indignado protest movement, which successfully occupied city squares around Spain last year, had refused to support Tuesday's demonstration.\r\nProtesters complained that police officers hid badges so they could not be identified. \"They don't wear them and we back that when they deal with violent groups. Give them hell and that's it!\" tweeted Jose Manuel Sanchez, of the SUP police union.\r\nTuesday's protests came shortly after Catalan regional prime minister Artur Mas called a snap election for 25 November amid a growing wave of support for separatism in Spain's wealthiest region.\r\nIndependence was set to be the key issue in elections, bringing Rajoy a fresh set of problems as he struggles with 25 percent unemployment and a double-dip recession.\r\nA radical association of retired Spanish servicemen, the Spanish Military Association, claimed that the constitution would oblige the army to arrest and try separatists if they unilaterally declared a separate country.\r\n",

However, a suspended sentence is considered more likely in the event of a conviction.",
